CLEAN and STRUCTURE the code using as much good practices as possible:


    - identify & isolate every paramter (threshold values, settings, etc.) in a dedicated module

    - OK isolate & wrap all the animation related stuff (animation count, choice, setting, etc.) in a dedicated class & module
    
    - OK create a class that stores (& computes) the LEDcontroler stuff (channel intensity...)

    - use chrono::duration rather than unsigned long for timestamps & time management
    - use a t_ d_ naming convention for timestamp vs duration

    - OK replace include guards with pragma once

    - !!! Ncurses for console output !!!!


ADD A CONFIGURATION CAPABILITY based on the following principles :
    Read a csv containing the config (define a format & write a parser function)
    Extract the values
    Extract animations
    Run them
