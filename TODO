CLEAN and STRUCTURE the code using as much good practices as possible:
    - enumerate everything that can be enumerated (variables, states, etc.)

    - give explicit & long name to all variables

    - construct classe whenever possible --> NO FUNCTIONS should be outside a classes

    - use WiringPi to deal with the arduino shit (delay(), millis(), etc.)

    - identify & isolate every paramter (threshold values, settings, etc.) in a dedicated module

    - isolate & wrap all the animation related stufff (animation count, choice, setting, etc.) in a dedicated class


ADD A CONFIGURATION CAPABILITY based on the following principles :
    Read a csv containing the config (define a format & write a parser function)
    Extract the values
    Extract animations
    Run them
