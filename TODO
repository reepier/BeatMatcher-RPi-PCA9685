CLEAN and STRUCTURE the code using as much good practices as possible:
    - identify & isolate every paramter (threshold values, settings, etc.) in a dedicated module
    - use chrono::duration rather than unsigned long for timestamps & time management
    - use a t_ d_ naming convention for timestamp vs duration

    - IN PROGRESS !!! Ncurses for console output !!!!


ADD A CONFIGURATION CAPABILITY based on the following principles :
    Read a csv containing the config (define a format & write a parser function)
    Extract the values
    Extract animations
    Run them

ADD command line input argumetns :
    - to enable/disable FAKEANALYSIS
        - when enabled, to set BPM ?
