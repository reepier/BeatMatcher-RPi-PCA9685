CLEAN and STRUCTURE the code using as much good practices as possible:
    - OK enumerate everything that can be enumerated (variables, states, etc.)

    - OK give explicit & long name to all variables

    - OK construct classes whenever possible 
        --> NO FUNCTIONS should be outside a class
        --> NO group of related Variables


    - OK use WiringPi to deal with the arduino shit (delay(), millis(), etc.)

    - identify & isolate every paramter (threshold values, settings, etc.) in a dedicated module

    - OK isolate & wrap all the animation related stuff (animation count, choice, setting, etc.) in a dedicated class & module
    
    - OK create a class that stores (& computes) the LEDcontroler stuff (channel intensity...)

    - use chrono::duration rather than ints for timestamps
    - use a t_ d_ naming convention for timestamp vs duration
    - OK replace include guards with pragma once

ADD A CONFIGURATION CAPABILITY based on the following principles :
    Read a csv containing the config (define a format & write a parser function)
    Extract the values
    Extract animations
    Run them
